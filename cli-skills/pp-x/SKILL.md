# X — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `x-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install x --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `x-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x/cmd/x-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the install step did not put the binary on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Combined CLI for multiple API services

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
x-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Auth Setup

Store your access token:

```bash
x-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` as an environment variable.

Run `x-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  x-pp-cli articles list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
x-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
x-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
x-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.x-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `X_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `X_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
x-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
x-pp-cli --profile briefing articles list
x-pp-cli profile list --json
x-pp-cli profile show briefing
x-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `x-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x/cmd/x-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add x-pp-mcp -- x-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which x-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   x-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `x-pp-cli <command> --help`.

## Hand-written notes (survive regen with `printing-press regen-merge`)

### Auth model — two sources

The X surface is split across two auth sources. The CLI selects per-host automatically.

**Source A — OAuth 2.0 PKCE.** Used for `api.x.com` v2 endpoints (tweets, users, lists, spaces, bookmarks, likes, etc.). Standard CLI flow:

```bash
x-pp-cli auth login        # opens browser, captures token
export X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN=<token>   # or set in config
x-pp-cli doctor            # verifies
```

**Source B — Browser session cookies.** Used for `x.com` Articles GraphQL endpoints and `upload.x.com` media upload. X's Articles editor is browser-only; OAuth 2.0 does NOT authenticate it. One-time capture:

1. In Chrome, open DevTools on `x.com` while logged in.
2. **Application → Cookies → x.com** → copy `auth_token` and `ct0` values.
3. **Network** → reload → click any `/i/api/graphql/...` request → **Request Headers** → copy the `Authorization: Bearer ...` value (this is the web app's hardcoded bearer, NOT a user OAuth token).
4. Write to `~/.config/x-pp-cli/cookies.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "auth_token": "<paste>",
     "ct0":        "<paste>",
     "web_bearer": "<paste, without the 'Bearer ' prefix>",
     "captured_at": "2026-05-08T22:00:00Z"
   }
   ```
5. `chmod 600 ~/.config/x-pp-cli/cookies.json`.

When X invalidates the session (logout, security events, ~weeks of inactivity), `articles *` commands return 401 — repeat the capture.

> Note: Chrome's "Save all as HAR with content" SILENTLY redacts cookies and the Authorization header. Do not try to extract them from a HAR — they will be missing. Use the DevTools Application/Network tabs above.

### Articles GraphQL operation hashes — runtime config

X Articles uses GraphQL with rotating operation hashes in the URL path (e.g. `/i/api/graphql/M7N2FrPrlOmu-YrVIBxFnQ/ArticleEntityUpdateContent`). The hash rotates when X redeploys their web app.

Hashes are loaded at runtime from `~/.config/x-pp-cli/article-ops.json`. A default capture from generation time (2026-05-08) is built into the binary as fallback. When `articles *` commands return 404 with "no such operation," refresh:

1. Re-sniff the Articles editor with the printing-press tool, OR
2. Capture a HAR via DevTools Network (any Articles operation), then:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, re
   from sys import argv
   with open(argv[1]) as f: h = json.load(f)
   ops = {}
   for e in h['log']['entries']:
       g = re.search(r'/i/api/graphql/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/(Article[A-Za-z0-9_]+)', e['request']['url'])
       if g: ops[g.group(2)] = g.group(1)
   import os, datetime
   path = os.path.expanduser('~/.config/x-pp-cli/article-ops.json')
   with open(path, 'w') as f: json.dump({'operations': ops, 'captured_at': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()}, f, indent=2)
   print(f'wrote {len(ops)} ops to {path}')
   " /path/to/your.har
   ```

### Hand-written compound commands

These are NOT auto-generated; they wrap multiple endpoints into single agent-friendly calls.

**`x-pp-cli thread compose <markdown-file>` [--post]**

Splits a markdown document into a numbered tweet thread (≤280 chars per tweet, atom-aware: paragraphs, list items, code fences are atoms; never splits inside a code fence). The "(N/M)" suffix length is reserved BEFORE packing so final tweets stay within the limit. Default behavior is dry-run (preview); `--post` is gated and not yet wired.

```bash
x-pp-cli thread compose draft.md         # dry-run preview
x-pp-cli thread compose draft.md --post  # (not yet wired — preview only)
```

**`x-pp-cli articles-publish-md <markdown-file>` [--post]**

Parses YAML frontmatter (`title`, `cover`, `tags`, `summary`) and converts the markdown body to Draft.js `content_state` JSON — the format the X Articles editor server-side expects.

Supported in v1 (text-only): paragraph, header-one (`#`), header-two (`##`), unordered-list-item (`-`/`*`), ordered-list-item (`1.`), blockquote (`>`), inline `**bold**` and `*italic*`.

NOT supported in v1: inline images, code blocks. The X Articles editor uses Draft.js atomic blocks for these but the entityMap binding mechanism is not yet understood from the captured HARs (the `entityMap` field in observed `UpdateContent` calls is consistently empty even when atomic blocks reference entity keys 0-N — entity data is attached via a separate API call we have not yet sniffed).

For articles WITH inline images or code blocks, use the existing `publish-x-article` skill (Playwright/CDP browser automation), which sidesteps the API by pasting HTML into the editor's Cmd+V handler.

```bash
# Markdown with frontmatter
cat > draft.md <<EOF
---
title: My Article
cover: ./cover.png
tags: [test]
---

# Header

A paragraph with **bold** text.

- bullet one
- bullet two
EOF

x-pp-cli articles-publish-md draft.md   # dry-run; prints constructed content_state JSON
```

The `--post` flag is gated and not yet orchestrated. The remaining engineering: parse frontmatter into the upload + create-draft + update-title + update-content + (optional) update-cover-media + publish call sequence, using Source B auth and the article-ops.json hash config.

### Known limitations of v1

- `--post` flags on `thread compose` and `articles-publish-md` are gated dry-runs only. Real post orchestration is the next engineering step.
- Inline images and code blocks in articles require entity-binding research not yet completed.
- Cookie capture is manual (DevTools). A `x-pp-cli auth capture-cookies` helper command is a future addition.
- Articles operation hash refresh is manual (re-sniff). Auto-refresh on 404 is a future addition.
