# X CLI

Combined CLI for multiple API services

Learn more at [X](https://docs.x.com/x-api).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `x-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-x` agent skill in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install x
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install x --cli-only
```


### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x/cmd/x-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/x-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-x --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-x --force
```

## Install for OpenClaw

Tell your OpenClaw agent (copy this):

```
Install the pp-x skill from https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/tree/main/cli-skills/pp-x. The skill defines how its required CLI can be installed.
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials

Get your access token from your API provider's developer portal, then store it:

```bash
x-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
x-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
x-pp-cli articles list
```

## Usage

Run `x-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

- **`x-pp-cli chat create-conversation`** - Creates a new encrypted Chat group conversation on behalf of the authenticated user.
- **`x-pp-cli chat get-conversation`** - Retrieves messages and key change events for a specific Chat conversation with pagination support. For 1:1 conversations, provide the recipient's user ID; the server constructs the canonical conversation ID from the authenticated user and recipient.

The server constructs the canonical conversation ID from the authenticated user
and recipient.

The request body must contain the conversation key version and participant keys
(the conversation key encrypted for each participant using their public key).

**Workflow (1:1 conversation):**
1. Generate a conversation key using the SDK
2. Encrypt the key for both participants using their public keys
3. Call this endpoint to register the keys
4. Send messages using `POST /chat/conversations/{id}/messages`

- Required scopes: `tweet.read`, `users.read`, `dm.write`
- **`x-pp-cli chat initialize-group`** - Initializes a new XChat group conversation and returns a unique conversation ID.

This endpoint is the first step in creating a group chat. The returned conversation_id 
should be used in subsequent calls to POST /chat/conversations/group to fully create and 
configure the group with members, admins, encryption keys, and other settings.

**Workflow:**
1. Call this endpoint to get a `conversation_id`
2. Use that `conversation_id` when calling `POST /chat/conversations/group` to create the group

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
x-pp-cli articles list

# JSON for scripting and agents
x-pp-cli articles list --json

# Filter to specific fields
x-pp-cli articles list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
x-pp-cli articles list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
x-pp-cli articles list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use with Claude Code

Install the focused skill — it auto-installs the CLI on first invocation:

```bash
npx skills add mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-x -g
```

Then invoke `/pp-x <query>` in Claude Code. The skill is the most efficient path — Claude Code drives the CLI directly without an MCP server in the middle.

<details>
<summary>Use as an MCP server in Claude Code (advanced)</summary>

If you'd rather register this CLI as an MCP server in Claude Code, install the MCP binary first:


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x/cmd/x-pp-mcp@latest
```

Then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add x x-pp-mcp -e X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

</details>

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/x-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x/cmd/x-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x": {
      "command": "x-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Health Check

```bash
x-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/x-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `x-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

## HTTP Transport

This CLI uses Chrome-compatible HTTP transport for browser-facing endpoints. It does not require a resident browser process for normal API calls.
